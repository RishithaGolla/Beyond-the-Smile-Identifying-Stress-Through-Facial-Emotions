# Beyond the Smile: Identifying Stress Through Facial Emotions
### **Project Report and Plan for Stress and Non-Stress Image Dataset Analysis**  

---

## **1. Introduction**  
Understanding human emotions is crucial in various fields, including mental health, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. The goal of this project is to analyze stress and non-stress emotional states using image datasets such as CK+ and TFEID. We will classify emotions into stress-related (e.g., sad, angry) and non-stress-related (e.g., happy, neutral) categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

---

## **2. Project Objectives**  

- Collect and preprocess the CK+ and TFEID datasets.  
- Categorize images into stress and non-stress groups.  
- Train and evaluate deep learning models for stress detection.  
- Compare model performance on different architectures (CNN, ResNet, etc.).  
- Create a Kaggle dataset and publish results for the research community.

## **3. Dataset Description**  

### **3.1 Sources**  
- **[CK+ (Cohn-Kanade Extended)](w)** – Facial expression dataset commonly used for emotion recognition.  
- **[TFEID (Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database)](w)** – Dataset containing various emotional expressions.  

### **3.2 Categorization**  
- **Non-Stress Emotions**: Happy, Neutral  
- **Stress Emotions**: Sad, Angry  

### **3.3 Preprocessing Steps**  
- Face detection and cropping using OpenCV.  
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment).  
- Normalization for model input.

- **Deep Learning Models**: CNN-based architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG16.  
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models like MobileNet for better accuracy.  

### **4.3 Training & Evaluation**  
- Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Apply cross-validation to ensure robustness.
